# Mastermind
A command-line java version of the Mastermind board game where the computer guesses a code: a certain number of colors in a particular order, and the user has to guess the colors in the same order. The user is given 20 attempts and is only told how many colors are in the right spot, how many are not in the right spot, and how many are in the code, but in the wrong spot.
